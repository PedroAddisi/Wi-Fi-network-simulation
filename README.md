# University Wi-Fi Network Simulation

This project is a **university assignment** created using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
It simulates the Wi-Fi network infrastructure of a university campus.

The PCs shown in the simulation are **symbolic**, as the subnet masks were adapted to support a larger number of devices than those explicitly represented in the topology.

## Network Features

- Wi-Fi network simulation
- VLANs implementation
- Wireless networks configured for different sectors
- DNS server configuration
- HTTP and HTTPS services enabled
- Subnet masks adapted for each sector to support scalability

## Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer

## Notes

To open this project, download the `.pkt` file and open it using Cisco Packet Tracer (version 8.x or later recommended).
